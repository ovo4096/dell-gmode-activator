# Dell Laptop G-Mode Activator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dell Laptop G-Mode Activator repository! This software is a simple yet effective solution to activate the G-Mode on your Dell or Alienware laptops, specifically addressing the irritating design flaws in the Alienware Command Center. Unlike the official software, which requires you to open the laptop lid and physically press the G-Mode button (a major issue when using an external monitor with the laptop lid closed), our tool allows easy activation with just a double-click.

## Features

- **Easy Activation**: Enable G-Mode on compatible Dell laptops without opening the laptop lid.
- **Performance Boost**: Optimize your laptop's performance for gaming and high-demand applications.
- **User-Friendly**: Simply double-click the `GMode.exe` file to run the application.
- **Open Source**: Core functionality implemented as an AutoHotkey script.
